# Cryptocurrency Wallet Generator and Blockchain

Project Description:
Now, for the project description:

Project Overview:
This project is a simple implementation of a cryptocurrency wallet generator and a blockchain using Python. It allows users to create new wallets, sign transactions, and mine new blocks.

Modules:
blockchain.py: Handles blockchain operations.
wallet.py: Manages wallet operations.
transaction.py: Defines the transaction model.
utils.py: Contains utility functions.
main.py: The main entry point of the application.
Libraries Used:
The main library used in developing the blockchain module is ecdsa. This library provides tools for cryptographic signature schemes, such as Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is commonly used in blockchain applications for generating and verifying digital signatures.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install ecdsa`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`
